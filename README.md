# Score Counter
Score Counter is one of my oldest and at the same time most useful Android application. It is written in Java, using SQLite for the database.

The goal of the application is to provide a good, customizable score counter that can be used for a great number of different board games.

Features:
*	Naming players
*	Custom background colour for a player
*	Switching player columns
*	Use either dynamic buttons (under last score row) or static buttons (always in the lower part of the screen)
*	Show subtotals
*	Change the color of specific score text
*	Change/Remove score
*	Possibility of different customize game modes with features
*	Constant score (+ & - buttons are used instead of typing number)
*	Only positive score
*	Strict rounds (player have to add a score in order)
*	Maximum rounds
*	Winning score
*	Finish round (When strict rounds and winning score is enabled)
*	Lowest score win
